# Results Directory

This directory contains the output files generated by the Figure 4 analysis.

## Files

### Sample Output (Generated with Dataset 07)
- **`figure_4_phenotype_complexity.png`** - Sample Figure 4 showing ELDER vs Ontology-only performance across phenotype complexity bins

### Generated Files (Created when you run the analysis)
When you run the analysis script, it will generate:
- **`figure_4_phenotype_complexity.svg`** - Vector format (publication-ready)
- **`figure_4_phenotype_complexity.png`** - Raster format (presentations)

## Usage

The sample figure shows the expected output when using dataset `normalized_phenopackets_07` (the default dataset with best ELDER performance).

When you run your own analysis, the script will overwrite these files with fresh results based on your chosen dataset and database.
